# PredictMe React App

PredictMe is a machine learning dapp that tries to showcase Iexec use cases.
The main goal is to show how machine learning models can be monetized.
Here the monetization model is pay per run. The dapp is a machine learning
model that tries to guess if the market will go down or up. Users that trade
can pay to get a prediction. Even tho the dapp is a demo, it shows a clear use case
for Iexec.
